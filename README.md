# trafic-light-bot

Arduino based project
Creates a suitable environment for public.
=======
Arduino based project on trafic lights.
Prevent the accident.
Simulate a traffic light using an Arduino and LEDs!
This project is super cool to make!
This simple little project uses an Arduino and some LEDs to replicate a traffic light. It uses code as an internal timer and continues to run until you cut the Arduino's power supply.

The materials are here as follows
1. Arduino/Genuino/Geekcreit/Whatever Uno
2. Breadboard
3. Jumper Wires
4. Red, Yellow, and Green Light Emitting Diode lights
5. Arduino USB 2.0 cable.
